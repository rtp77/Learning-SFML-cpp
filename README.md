# Learning-SFML-cpp
This is a personal project which will be updated on regular basis. Feel free to edit or contribute.

This repository is a journey of learning SFML as well as revisiting concepts in C++.
Minimum of 1 hour per day is given for SFML so incase what i learnt is less of value it will be grouped up in one single program.
Although the project is named SFML most of the work will be done in learning C++ and advancing in developing numerical simulation or calculations.

In the future hopefull the repo will be used efficiently.
